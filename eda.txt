  19698: I blocked a few goals at my last game and we won. I also learned where I'm going to be staying when I go to college.
  Speaker 2: Wow, nice job, congrats, I wish I saw that game! And? Where?
  Speaker 1: Reed College in Oregon. I am going to be heading of f there next year. I wonder if I can walk onto their Lacrosse team? 
  Speaker 2: I've heard about that one actually, my friend considered going there. Yeah, I think it's great choice for you, their Lacrosse team is pretty good from what I've heard. Do you want to go pro after college?
  Speaker 1: Heck yeah, that would be my hope. What about you; do you think you will play soccer in college?
  Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure I will, yeah. Everyone needs a goalie, you know how it is, we're a rare kind haha. I haven't picked a college yet though, so maybe I'll look into Reed's soccer team and we can go there together, what do you think?
  Speaker 1: That would be pretty great then we could room together. You're not wrong about that goalies are definitely a rare breed not all people want balls and or parks to be lost at them at a high velocity and it takes a special person to want to put their body in front of it. We're playing goalie do you like to use the same brand of cleats as well as for your gloves as well? I tend to use the same brands for my gear.
  Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely, there's no other kind of brand that gives me such certainty in my success. I know it sounds like something straight from the ad, but they do make one hell of a quality equipment :)
  Speaker 1: Nike? Is that the brand you are speaking about?
  Speaker 2: Correct, I've mentioned this before. My brother works there, so I get a discount too haha. Even though the main thing is teamplay, I feel like equipment matters a lot too.
  Speaker 1: yeah I thought so! that is cool to get a discount. Do you want to go the corp store in Oregon when we get to Reed? You know there is no sales tax in OR! And i agree it makes a big difference in Lacrosse as well. Does your bro play soccer too?
  Speaker 2: That's a good idea, I think we should do it, yes. No, he's more into tennis actually. He plays soccer sometimes, mostly when I'm taking him with me to the training, but that's definitely not his favorite sport.

  Speaker 1: What do you catch besides tuna?  Does a job as a fisherman pay a decent amount?  I always see the shows where the people fish for crab and they make a ton!
  Speaker 2: I get by alright. I don't catch the  Tuna that are worth as much as you see on the show Wicked Tuna. I go after a lot of red snapper when they are in season also.

  Speaker 2: Oh yea they put up a fight. Most fish that live in water with currents are really strong. Even small ones.

  Speaker 1: I love cornbread. I wish I could get good soul food in my area. At least there is an okay Italian place within walking distance of my house.
  Speaker 2: I should ship some over to you! We make cornbread that is to die for. What's your favorite dish at the Italian joint?

  Speaker 1: I'm assuming the menu is on your website. Any dishes you'd recommend?
  Speaker 2: I'd look at getting some of our fried okra. We sell it such that all you have to do is heat it up in the microwave, and it tastes just like it was served fresh at the restaurant!
  Speaker 1: Awesome. Thanks. I'll give it a try. My cooking skills suck, but I'm an excellent microwaver.

Dialogue:
  Speaker 1: How was the spring training game? Were you able to watch it at all? Ready to catch some fish?
  Speaker 2: The game got rained out.  That was a good excuse to go fishing.
  Speaker 1: Oh, so you already went fishing? Have you caught anything special?
  Speaker 2: I never seem to catch very much of anything.  To be fair I like the ambiance as much as the actual fish-catching.
  Speaker 1: Understood. It's the opposite for me - I'm all about catching the biggest fish haha. 
  Speaker 2: Do you keep them and cook them?  Or stuff and mount them? Or are you a catch-and-release person?
  Speaker 1: The latter. I'm too lazy to cook them and stuffing is a lot of work too. Also I just feel bad about the fish, so I'm just releasing it back into the water. What about you?
  Speaker 2: It depends.  Sometimes I just catch them and put them back.  But once in a while I'll keep a real trophy fish, or I'll fish specifically to get dinner.
  Speaker 1: Oh, that's interesting. Do you have any recipes to share? Something fast and easy preferably.
  Speaker 2: I'm pretty simple in the kitchen.  I just pan fry them.  Maybe if I'm feeling adventurous I'll bread them and fry them.  But that's pretty rare.
  Speaker 1: Haha that's my type of cooking for sure. Which fish do you like the most?
  Speaker 2: I'm really partial to catfish although I don't catch them around here.  I grill catfish.  Around here I catch walleye mostly and those I pan fry.

Dialogue:
  Speaker 1: Mia, I found an interesting book about a famous baseball player I think you would like.
  Speaker 2: That's great, I'd love to give it a read.  Who is it about?
  Speaker 1: It's about Babe Ruth, but it focuses more on his journey through childhood and as a young adult rather than his baseball career. It's very inspirational and moving. I blazed through it in one sitting! If you want I can send it to you so you can read it while you walk to work. 
  Speaker 2: I'm always looking for new books to read on my walk, sounds great!  You always recommend the best books. How is your renovation going? 
  Speaker 1: Cool beans, I'll send it over your way tomorrow! It's going fairly well actually. I'll have to show you some pictures, it's very modern and everything has a sleek finish. I knocked down the wall in the kitchen so now it's wide open with the dining room. Has your apartment still been giving you trouble with how stuffy it is?
  Speaker 2: I cannot wait to see all that you have done.  Maybe you will motivate me to do the same.  Opening up the floor plan may make the apartment seem less stuffy.  I try to keep the balcony open but have to close it during the day.  One of my neighbor's cats got in last time I left the door open and I had quite an allergy attack!
  Speaker 1: Oh no, that's terrible! You know, I heard a good way to keep cats out is to have bowls of water laying in front of the doors. It's an old trick my family used to do to keep cats from coming in, you should give it a try! By the way, I heard your soccer team made it to the finals, congratulations!
  Speaker 2: I will give it a try - you are going to be a great cat owner once you find a couple kittens to adopt!  Yes, thank you! We barely made it in and scored the winning goal in the very last minute of the game.  It was a good one.  If you're not working at the flower shop on Saturday, you should come watch it!
  Speaker 1: I would love that! Is it too corny if I make a sign with your number on it? I'll even bring some flowers from the shop to celebrate, I feel like I just know you're going to win!
  Speaker 2: You are such a good friend, go for it!! The sign I think will help me play better. After that we should try the new vegetarian restaurant that is close to the soccer field.  I went there a few weeks ago and they have the BEST fried green beans.
  Speaker 1: Oh my gosh, totally! I'm so excited, I feel like I haven't seen you in forever. I miss going to new restaurants and trying their food with you. I feel like we both got caught up with work and drifted apart a little bit, but I'm so excited to be seeing you this weekend!

Dialogue:
  Speaker 1: I took care of a chihuahua at the animal shelter!
  Speaker 2: Oh, cool! I am looking to adopt soon, and am strongly considering a chihuahua I met at a local shelter. Do you have advice for people thinking of adopting from shelters?
  Speaker 1: My only advice is do it! There are so many sweet babies in the shelters that need homes and usually they make the best pets. 
  Speaker 2: That's what I was thinking too. It makes sad how many pets don't belong to the best homes, and I want to help with that. Have you ever adopted from a shelter, or one you volunteer at?
  Speaker 1: I know:( I wish I could take them all home. I have! Infact, my oldest cat was a rescue from a shelter. Shes the sweetest thing.
  Speaker 2: I have never had a cat, but I would like to get one soon I think. They seem lower maintenance than dogs. Do you prefer dogs or cats?
  Speaker 1: I love them both but dogs are much more sociable and interacting where as cats kind of only want snuggles or love on their terms if that makes sense.
  Speaker 2: Cats do seem less affectionate overall but it might be nice that they're lower maintenance. Dogs feel like more a member of the family though. Do cats require much attention when you volunteer?
  Speaker 1: Not really, they just need food and water. They like to play a little bit. I would say they like to play for maybe 20 to 30 minutes.
  Speaker 2: That's great. I have plenty of time to take care of pets most of the time, but I also need to figure out what to do with them while I travel. Speaking of which, have you been in Paris lately?
  Speaker 1: Usually your local vet will have a boarding program that isn't very costly. I haven't lately but have a trip planned soon!
  Speaker 2: That's exciting! And good to know. I am going to be in Paris again very soon. Are there any spots in Paris you might recommend?

    - My favorite sport is Hockey.
    - I need a work out partner. I go to gym frequently. I do not have any close friends locally. I don't know many people in this area. I am looking for a gym partner.
    - For me, working out is a natural high and is addictive. When I'm working out, I focus on the muscles while I lift weights. I don't usually listen to music while working out.
    - I am not familiar with Insane Clown Posse.
    - I am a business major, but am getting bored with it.

Dialogue:
  Speaker 1: How was your last workout?
  Speaker 2: It was okay, I think working out every day makes it so my workouts aren't the greatest. I think I need to build in a rest day. Any new interior design clients?
  Speaker 1: Unfortunately no but I'm not letting it get me discouraged, just have to keep at it. As far as your workout situation yeah, you're body needs time to rest and heal between workout or you're not doing yourself any good. Maybe treat yourself to a spa/massage day. 
  Speaker 2: I feel like since it's summer, most people are thinking about the outside of their home, I bet business will pick up come fall, when people are spending more time inside. 
  Speaker 1: You're probably right, I didn't think about it that way. That gives me more motivation to keep waiting for new clientele. I know you're getting bored being with your business major any thoughts on which direction you might go instead or do you think you'll just tough it out and hope you find new optimism relating to it? 
  Speaker 2: I am toughing it out. Hopefully I will have an epiphany someday of what I really want to do. I guess having a business degree is important for most jobs these days. So I am not wasting my time.
  Speaker 1: That's true it's definitely useful. I know you're looking for a gym partner I might know someone who would be willing to work out with you. The guy is a literal gym rat I'll have to get in contact with him and see if he's interested in finding a gym buddy and get back to you. 
  Speaker 2: That would be awesome! I'd appreciate his insight and ideas. I am kinda just going along with what I know and what I read about. Would love a partner! Thanks so much.
  Speaker 1: Yeah no problem, it'll probably take me a few days to get a hold of him and get his response. He's a little slow communicating but overall he's a good person and like I said he is all about the gym life. Do you have any hobbies besides working out? 
  Speaker 2: That's not a problem! I've been going it alone for so long. It'll be nice to have the company eventually. I enjoy tasting craft beer - so going around to the local taprooms and getting tasting flights.
  Speaker 1: Oh, that's neat. I've met a few people who are beer enthusiasts personally I don't drink at all. Well let me rephrase that I'll have MAYBE one beer when I'm out with friends but even when I'm out with friends it's an extremely rare occasion that I'll actually drink. 
  Speaker 2: Do you enjoy the taste or just get it because you are out with friends? My dad only drinks because he's around people, he doesn't even like the taste!

  Speaker 2: Seriously you are in for one heck of a show! Are you going with some friends?
  Speaker 1: Yes, I convinced a couple of guys and a girl from the office to go with me.  One of the guys is a fan and then the other guy and the girl were just wanting to do something different.  It should be fun.

  Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be awesome if you could come along.  I'll see if I can record some of it and I'll send you the video.
  Speaker 2: Thanks! It's so hard to get around New York sometimes without a car. I'll just have to munch on some Detroit style deep dish pizza and pretend I'm there.
  Speaker 1: For sure.  Speaking of that, I think we're going to try to get some dinner before the show.  Do you have any restaurants that you particularly love in the city?  I haven't found anything new in quite a while that's excited me all that much.
  Speaker 2: Katz's Delicatessen is my go-to. They're also open at all crazy hours of the night, so you can even stop by after if you're inclined. The atmosphere is amazing, the waitstaff is top notch, and there's a huge variety of food to pig out on
  Speaker 1: That's a great idea!  Maybe we'll get some drinks and some appetizers from someplace before the concert and then anyone who's hungry afterwards can go to Katz's for some late-night sustenance.  What do you typically get when you eat there?
  Speaker 2: I can't resist their brisket sandwich.. it's just so tender and rich in flavor. And their NY egg cream is to do for. It's such a unique experience.

  Speaker 2: I know, I'm glad your grandson has that interest. My friend tells me he can barely get his son to pick up a book let alone read one... 
  Speaker 1: yeah, that's tough! reading opens them up to so many things, not to mention it gets them ahead in their classes a lot of the time. their vocabulary expands so much just by reading a few books. it's a great tool!
  Speaker 2: You're absolutely correct! That's why I wanted to become a writer in the first place. I hope I can inspire kids who are so much more absorbed with their phones nowadays to still pick up a book and gain all of those benefits.

Dialogue:
  Speaker 1: I was thinking about reading a horror novel. What's the best horror novel you've read lately?
  Speaker 2: House of Leaves is low key a great horror novel. It's a bit of a hard read and considered an achievement among readers because it's 1000 pages and a little odd. Have you heard of it?
  Speaker 1: I have heard of it but had no idea what it was about. What makes it a hard read? Is it the 1000 pages? Thank you for the recommendation.
  Speaker 2: It reads a bit like a textbook, but also it has footers that add to that "textbook" feel. If you would rather read a horror novel about the beach, you could always read Jaws.
  Speaker 1: I get enough textbooks in my field of work teaching. Maybe Jaws would be a better start. I enjoyed the film but how closely related are the books?
  Speaker 2: Of course the movies are always a bit different from books with all that artistic liberty. Give it a read and see if you like it. Maybe we can go bowling sometime and discuss the book?
  Speaker 1: That would be good, bowling is one of my favorite past times. Do you bowl much? 
  Speaker 2: Not much, but I would like to pick up some more hobbies to get me out of the library. I've always wanted to try that duckpin bowling. Have you done that or do you just stick to traditional bowling?
  Speaker 1: Normally traditional bowling but I am up for trying duckpin bowling. I feel like there would be good cross over.
  Speaker 2: I'm sure it can't beat traditional bowling. It's probably a lot more for the younger crowd so we probably would stand out. 
  Speaker 1: I would imagine so. I have tried taking my grandkids and they just roll the balls down the ramps. With duckpin bowling they can probably throw them themselves.
  Speaker 2: The ball is much smaller so they probably can throw it themselves. I think it's like a little cannonball. It would be cute to see them tossing it down the lane.

  Speaker 1: You'll hear a lot of guitar by us but I have a feeling you'll like that more than just banging drums all day. In fact, my dad just learned some very soothing songs that would probably even be good to play while doing yoga.  How is your practice going?
